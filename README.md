# Correct timecodes with difference

With this tool (or script) you can correct your timecodes for the value than you need.

I.e., you have the next list:

```text
00:00:00 Waiting streamer
00:01:58 Stream has started
00:32:45 Main theme
01:41:12 Next topic
```

And corrected value for each line, i.e., `00:01:58`.

Now you can take corrected list on second board (recalculation takes automatically).
